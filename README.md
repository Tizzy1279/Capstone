# Capstone Project - Simplilearn

Enabling AI-Powered Business Intelligence for Organizations

Problem scenario:

In today’s data-centric business environment, organizations across various industries accumulate vast amounts of information. However, many struggle to transform this data into actionable insights, especially small to medium-sized enterprises that lack the resources for advanced business intelligence tools.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, especially in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offer immense potential for data analysis and insight generation.
 
Project objective:

InsightForge, an innovative Business Intelligence Assistant, aims to address these challenges by developing an automated AI model using advanced technologies, including LangChain, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Large Language Models (LLMs).

This model aims to:
•	Analyze business data: Perform comprehensive analysis to identify key trends and patterns
•	Generate insights and recommendations: Utilize natural language processing to deliver actionable business insights
•	Visualize data insights: Present insights through visualizations for easier interpretation







Steps to follow:
The project is divided into the following steps, each focusing on a critical aspect of the system:

Part 1: AI-Powered Business Intelligence Assistant

1.  Data preparation
•	Focus on analyzing and extracting insights from pre-prepared data, rather than on data cleaning

2. Knowledge base creation
•	Load and explore the dataset
•	Organize the data into a structured format suitable for retrieval and analysis

3. LLM application development

•	Advanced data summary: Analyze the data to identify key metrics and trends, including:
1.	Sales performance by time period
2.	Product and regional analysis
3.	Customer segmentation by demographics
4.	Statistical measures (e.g., median, standard deviation)

•	Integration with RAG System:
1.	Utilize pandas for data processing
2.	Develop a custom retriever to extract relevant statistics
3.	Implement prompt engineering to guide the LLM in generating accurate responses

4. Chain prompts
•	Design prompts to ensure the LLM produces coherent and contextually relevant responses

5. RAG system setup
•	 Implement the RAG system to enhance the LLM’s ability to generate detailed and accurate responses based on retrieved data



6. Memory integration 
•	Integrate memory systems to enable the model to retain and use contextual information from previous interactions, thereby improving the relevance of responses

Part 2: LLMOps (Model Evaluation, Monitoring,
and User Interface Creation Using Streamlit)

7. External tool integration

•	Model evaluation: Apply QAEvalChain to assess the model's performance and accuracy

•	Data visualization: Create various plots and visualizations to present insights, including:
1.	Sales trends over time
2.	Product performance comparisons
3.	Regional analysis
4.	Customer demographics and segmentation

•	Streamlit UI: Develop an intuitive user interface using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the AI assistant and access visualizations and insights
